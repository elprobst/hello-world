# hello-world
This is my first Git-Hub project.  

My name is Elijah Probst and I am a Computer Information Systems student at Portland Community College.  
My background is in sales/marketing for the private sector as well as development and grant-writing for the non-profit sector.  

I am very excited to begin my transition into the world of tech!  So far my interests include:
-Programming in Python
-Database analysis and management

I hope to use GitHub as a repository for class projects to showcase the skills that I am developing over the course of this professional 
development process.
